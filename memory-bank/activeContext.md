## Current Focus

*   Enhancing bot status monitoring and adding Telegram command for status inquiry.

## Recent Changes

*   Initial project setup and core script development (`b_volume_alerts.py`, `telegram_alerts.py`).
*   Integration of TradingView and Binance trade URLs in Telegram alerts.
*   Implementation of number formatting with thousand separators in Telegram alerts.
*   Resolution of `ModuleNotFoundError` and `setuptools` "Multiple top-level modules" error by configuring `pyproject.toml` with `py-modules`.
*   Transition from internal scheduling/cron to `systemd` service for robust execution.
*   Updates to `README.md` and `setup_bot_server.sh` for `systemd` configuration.
*   Creation of standard Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `architecture_diagram.md`, `changelog.md` ).

## Open Questions/Issues

*   **Binance API Geographical Restriction**: The script encounters `BinanceAPIException: APIError(code=0): Service unavailable from a restricted location` when run from certain IP addresses (e.g., DigitalOcean **USA** servers). Solution is to run the script from europena IP addresses
*   **Systemd Service Monitoring**: While `Restart=always` is configured, continuous monitoring of `journalctl` logs is needed to ensure the service is consistently restarting and running as expected, especially after initial setup.
[2025-08-06 14:09:00] - Implemented filtering for "bullish" volume in alerts.
[2025-08-18 19:15:23] - Completed implementation and testing of `hummingbot_integration.py`. The module provides an interface for managing Hummingbot instances, including creation, deployment, status checks, and stopping/archiving.
[2025-08-19 10:26:30] - Implemented granular bot status updates in `bot_monitor.py` (active, stopped reasons, PnL/open orders from logs).
[2025-08-19 10:26:30] - Added `/status` Telegram command in `telegram_bot_handler.py` for bot status inquiry (single or all active bots) and updated `/help` message.
[2025-08-19 10:26:30] - Resolved `NameError: name 're' is not defined` in `telegram_bot_handler.py` by adding `import re`.
[2025-08-19 10:26:30] - Confirmed that PnL and open order data are extracted from log messages using regex, as structured JSON fields are not currently available.
