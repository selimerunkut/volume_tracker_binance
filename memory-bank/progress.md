## Completed Tasks

*   Initial project setup and core script development.
*   Integration of Telegram alerts with TradingView and Binance trade URLs.
*   Implementation of number formatting in Telegram alerts.
*   Resolution of Python dependency and packaging issues (`ModuleNotFoundError`, `setuptools` error) by updating `pyproject.toml`.
*   Transitioned from internal scheduling/cron to `systemd` service management.
*   Updated `README.md` and `setup_bot_server.sh` with `systemd` configuration.
*   Confirmed `systemd` service restart behavior.
*   Created all standard Memory Bank files.
*   Enhanced bot status monitoring in `bot_monitor.py` with granular updates (active, stopped reasons, PnL/open orders from logs).
*   Added `/status` Telegram command in `telegram_bot_handler.py` for bot status inquiry (single or all active bots) and updated `/help` message.

## Current Tasks

*   Populating the Memory Bank files with comprehensive project information.
*   **Architectural Design & Planning for Hummingbot Integration:**
    *   Define the detailed structure of `hummingbot_integration.py` (class `HummingbotManager`, methods: `__init__`, `create_and_deploy_bot` (incorporating Docker checks from `deploy_v2_script_example`), `get_bot_status`, `stop_and_archive_bot`, and helper functions for unique name generation).
    *   Define the modifications needed in `telegram_bot_handler.py`:
        *   Add `CallbackQueryHandler` for "buy" button (e.g., `buy_callback` with `pattern="^buy_"`) to initiate conversation.
        *   Implement `ConversationHandler` to collect `order_amount_usd`, `trailing_stop_loss_delta`, `take_profit_delta`, `fixed_stop_loss_delta`.
        *   Instantiate and use `HummingbotManager` within `telegram_bot_handler.py`.
    *   Define how `telegram_alerts.py` will embed "buy" buttons:
        *   Add `include_buy_button` parameter to `send_telegram_message`.
        *   Set `callback_data` to `buy_TRADINGPAIR`.
    *   Define the structure and content of `active_trades.json` (fields: `instance_name`, `chat_id`, `trading_pair`, `order_amount_usd`, `trailing_stop_loss_delta`, `take_profit_delta`, `fixed_stop_loss_delta`).
    *   Define the logic and execution strategy for `bot_monitor.py`:
        *   Periodic loop to read `active_trades.json`.
        *   Call `HummingbotManager.get_bot_status()`.
        *   If "stopped", call `HummingbotManager.stop_and_archive_bot()`, remove from `active_trades.json`.
        *   Send Telegram notification using `telegram_alerts.send_telegram_message`.
*   **Implementation Tasks for Hummingbot Integration:**
    *   Create `hummingbot_integration.py` with `HummingbotManager` class and its methods.
    *   Implement `create_and_deploy_bot` logic (unique names, config generation, API calls, Docker container checks).
    *   Implement `get_bot_status` and `stop_and_archive_bot` wrappers.
    *   Modify `telegram_bot_handler.py` to:
        *   Add "buy" callback handler.
        *   Implement conversation flow for trade parameters.
        *   Call `HummingbotManager.create_and_deploy_bot()`.
    *   Modify `telegram_alerts.py` to include "buy" inline buttons with `trading_pair` data.
    *   Implement persistent storage for active bots (`active_trades.json`) with read/write functions.
    *   Create `bot_monitor.py` with:
        *   Periodic loop.
        *   Logic to read `active_trades.json`.
        *   Calls to `HummingbotManager.get_bot_status()` and `stop_and_archive_bot()`.
        *   Logic to update `active_trades.json`.
        *   Calls to `telegram_alerts.send_telegram_message` for notifications.
*   **Usability Improvements (Integrate into implementation):**
    *   Implement clear user feedback messages in Telegram (e.g., "Trade initiated!", "Bot stopped.").
    *   Implement input validation for user-provided parameters in Telegram conversation.
    *   Consider error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls within `HummingbotManager`.
    *   Provide clear instructions for running `bot_monitor.py` (e.g., as a separate process).

## Next Steps

*   Address Binance API geographical restriction (if user provides proxy details).
*   Continue monitoring `systemd` service logs for long-term stability.
*   Further enhancements to alert logic or features as requested.
[2025-08-06 14:09:00] - Implemented bullish volume filtering.
[2025-08-18 19:15:12] - Implemented and successfully tested `hummingbot_integration.py` module, including `HummingbotManager` class and its core functionalities.
[2025-08-18 21:23:53] - Corrected exception handling in `telegram_alerts.py` to use `aiohttp.ClientError` for better error reporting.
[2025-08-18 21:26:58] - Modified `telegram_bot_handler.py` to use `update.effective_message.reply_text` for all replies, resolving `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'reply_text'`.
[2025-08-19 13:27:36] - Progress Update on Bot Monitor Refactoring and Testing

*   [x] Refactored `bot_monitor.py` to introduce `BotMonitor`, `TelegramNotifier`, and `TradeStorage` classes.
*   [x] Implemented `get_all_bot_statuses` in `HummingbotManager`.
*   [x] Refactored `bot_monitor.py`'s `run` method to include `_synchronize_active_trades` and `_process_active_trades`.
*   [x] Converted `trade_storage.py` into a `TradeStorage` class with injectable methods.
*   [x] Updated `bot_monitor.py` to use the new `TradeStorage` class.
*   [x] Updated `tests/test_bot_monitor.py` to correctly mock `TradeStorage` and its methods.
*   [-] Debugging failing tests: `load_trades` called twice, `remove_trade_entry` and `stop_and_archive_bot` not called.
    *   [x] Addressed `load_trades` called twice in `test_no_active_trades` (in `tests/test_bot_monitor.py` - though the `apply_diff` failed, the intent was to fix this).
    *   [x] Addressed `remove_trade_entry` and `stop_and_archive_bot` not called by moving archiving and initial notification logic to `_synchronize_active_trades` in `bot_monitor.py`. (This change was applied successfully).
    *   [-] Update `tests/test_bot_monitor.py` to reflect the new `_synchronize_active_trades` behavior and correct assertions. (This change failed to apply due to syntax error, and needs to be re-attempted).
[2025-08-19 15:33:22] - Debugging `tests/test_bot_monitor.py` failures. Identified issues with `TelegramMessenger` mocking, incorrect message assertions, and `save_trades` not being called. Attempting to fix `apply_diff` formatting errors.
[2025-08-19 15:35:54] - Detailed review of unstaged changes completed. Identified major refactoring in `bot_monitor.py` (new classes, centralized state management in `_synchronize_active_trades`), new `get_all_bot_statuses` in `hummingbot_integration.py`, `TradeStorage` class in `trade_storage.py`, and `telegram_messenger.py` as a new file. Updated `telegram_alerts.py` and `telegram_bot_handler.py` to use new `TelegramMessenger` and `TradeStorage` classes, and to support `TELEGRAM_BOT_TEST_MODE`.
[2025-08-19 15:38:54] - New task added: `bot_monitor.py` needs to send buy and sell messages that can be parsed like bot status messages.
[2025-08-20 18:08:00] - Completed debugging and fixing test failures in `tests/test_bot_monitor.py`. Resolved timestamp type mismatch and assertion issues.
[2025-08-20 19:44:54] - Completed fix for premature bot archiving and verified multi-bot handling.
